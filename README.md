# Example Shopify Node App
A simple app built to gain a base understanding of interfacing with Shopify's API in a NodeJS context.

## Install
1. Create a [Shopify Partner Account](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Create a partner app with generated API credentials
3. From the root directory: `npm init`
4. `npm install express dotenv request request-promise --save`
5. `touch .env`
6. Add your credentials and app url to the `.env` file
7. Visit your app url with a `shop` param.

For greater base familiarity with Shopify's API, I recommend having the [documentation](https://developers.shopify.com/) available for reference if needed.
